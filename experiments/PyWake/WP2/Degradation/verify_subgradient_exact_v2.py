Verification of the exact rainflow sub-gradient.   (revision of 29 July 2026)
===========================================================================

Verifies the spanning-set sub-gradient of degradation_subgradient.py, which
implements Chapter 2 Equations eq:subgrad_charge and eq:subgrad_discharge. This
is the per-timestep leg of the gradient verification. The capacity gradient is
the aggregate leg and is checked by verify_gradient_finite_difference.py; a
single scalar per year cannot see how the sensitivity is distributed over the
horizon, which is the question answered here.

Reads the .npy pair from  Results/RTE Tests/ , which is where
run_battery_xu_shi_degradation_v5_6_RTE_test.py writes them (RESULTS_DIR, line 134).
Do NOT point this at Results/ : the pair sitting there is left over from an older
routing of the script, and its two files came from different runs.

Checks
------
  GUARD    Are storage_e and e_cap from the same solve? If the trace never reaches
           soc_max, the two files are out of sync and every normalized depth below
           is wrong. Checked first and loudly, because a stale e_cap silently
           rescales everything.

  TEST A   Exactness at a reference step, split into two populations:
             smooth : forward and backward differences agree, so the cost is
                      differentiable at that time step.
             kink   : they disagree, so the rainflow map changes combinatorial
                      structure under the perturbation and the cost is not
                      differentiable. A central difference returns the AVERAGE of
                      the two one-sided derivatives and cannot match any
                      sub-gradient. The analytic value must instead coincide with
                      ONE of them, which is what makes it a valid element of the
                      sub-differential. TEST A2 checks that directly.

           Reporting one median against a central difference conflates the two and
           hides failures. That is how the attribution bug survived: median
           0.000 percent, max 1512 percent.

  TEST A2  Sub-differential bracket at the kinks. Is the analytic value inside
           [min, max] of the two one-sided derivatives, and does it sit at an
           endpoint rather than in the interior.

  TEST A3  Step-size sweep on the time steps that stay smooth at every step. At
           one fixed step the residual is dominated by the truncation error of
           the difference, not by any error in the analytic value, so a single
           number cannot support a claim of machine precision. Same logic as the
           capacity-gradient sweep, applied per timestep.

  TEST B   Efficiency identity, pointwise. |df/dd_t| / |df/dc_t| = 1/(eta_in*eta_out)
           at EVERY timestep, exactly, because G(t) is common to both. A ratio of
           MEANS over the horizon is not a valid test: it recovers the coefficient
           ratio only when the charging and discharging depth distributions coincide,
           which is why it read exactly 1/eta_out while the attribution map was
           collapsed onto a single cycle.

  TEST C   Why S_sigma is excluded from the gradient path. Depth-only analytic
           against a central difference of the S_sigma-weighted cost, on the
           smooth population only, because a central difference at a kink is not
           a derivative. The gap is the non-local mean-SoC term. Chapter 2
           subsec:depth_only claims more than two orders of magnitude and cites
           this section for the number.

Changes in this revision
------------------------
  1. thesis_style.py for fonts, colours and figure width. The previous version
     hardcoded three hex values and used tight_layout with bbox_inches="tight",
     the opposite of the savefig.bbox = "standard" convention, so its figure was
     the only one in the thesis at a different scale.
  2. TEST A3 replaces the printed claim "must be machine precision", which sat
     next to a median of 1.79e-05 % at a fixed 1e-6 step. That is truncation
     error of the difference, not an error in the analytic value.
  3. Percentiles and a robust error scale. The previous denominator was
     max(|central difference|, 1e-9), so any step where the derivative passes
     through zero inflated without limit and produced a 4.5e8 relative error.
     The magnitude of the derivative at that step is now printed alongside, and
     the old normalisation is still computed so the artefact can be reported and
     dismissed rather than found by someone else.
  4. TEST A2, the bracket test.
  5. TEST C restricted to the smooth population.
  6. Summary CSV, as every other verification artefact in the thesis has.
  7. Module-family assertion. degradation_xu and degradation_shi both define
     fit_shi_polynomial, phi_shi and phi_shi_prime. degradation_subgradient
     imports phi_shi_prime from the Xu copy while the cost here uses phi_shi
     from the Shi copy. They agree today and nothing enforces it. Note their
     positional signatures differ, so every call here uses keywords.
  8. The SoC window is read from WP2_Battery.yaml when it can be found, and
     RTE_AC is the value the run script derives rather than a rounded 0.910.
  9. Figures. The old left panel plotted the central difference against the
     analytic value for both populations, which shows 97 points far off the
     diagonal at the kinks. Those points are meaningless by the section's own
     argument, so the panel argued against the result. It is replaced by the
     step-size sweep and by a bracket figure that makes the sub-differential
     claim visible. Say the word and the parity panel comes back.

Run from VS Code on Windows, in the folder holding degradation_xu.py,
