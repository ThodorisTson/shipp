verify_week_snapshot.py  --  short-horizon view of the real dispatch

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Chapter 4 goes straight from the model description to a 20-year simulation. This
script produces the missing intermediate: the real dispatch at a scale a reader
can follow, one week, on real ERA5 wind and real DK1 prices, at the same design
as the baseline run.

It is NOT a synthetic test. Everything here is the production dispatch.

WHY YEAR 1 ONLY
---------------
Inside the multi-year loop, year 1 is solved at nominal capacity with a free
starting state, so a standalone annual solve reproduces it exactly. The script
proves that rather than assuming it: CHECK 1 compares its own year-1 state of
charge against annual_soc[0] in the stored baseline .npy. If they disagree, the
week shown here is not a window into the run that produced Section 4.3 and the
script stops.

That equivalence is what lets the window series be computed cheaply. Five annual
solves take a couple of minutes; the 20-year sweep takes half an hour.

COUNTING
--------
The dispatch is solved for the whole year and the week is a slice of it, so the
battery enters the week already charging or discharging with the state of charge
the year gave it. Rainflow counting is likewise done once on the full year;
cycles are then assigned to the week containing their midpoint. Nothing is
recounted in isolation.

WEEK SELECTION
--------------
Chosen by a stated rule, not by eye. The default picks the week whose mean daily
price spread is closest to the annual median, so the figure cannot be accused of
showing a flattering week. Override with WEEK_RULE or WEEK_INDEX.

RUNNING IT
----------
    python verify_week_snapshot.py              redraw from the cache if present
    python verify_week_snapshot.py --resolve    solve the five annual LPs again

The cache stores the raw solved series only. Rainflow counting, the weekly
assignment, the degradation and every figure are recomputed each time, so
cosmetic and analytical changes need no re-solve.

OUTPUT
------
  Results/Week Snapshot/week_snapshot_cache.npz      solved series, for redraws
  Results/Week Snapshot/week_snapshot_hourly.csv     hourly series, all windows
  Results/Week Snapshot/week_snapshot_summary.csv    per-window week statistics
  Results/Week Snapshot/fig_week_dispatch.pdf/.png   Figure A
  Results/Week Snapshot/fig_week_rainflow.pdf/.png   Figure B
  Results/Week Snapshot/fig_week_width.pdf/.png      Figure C
  Results/Week Snapshot/week_snapshot_cycles.csv     every counted cycle
  Results/Week Snapshot/week_snapshot_checks.csv     dispatch invariance check

Reproducible on Windows / VS Code. Needs the same stack as the run script:
pyomo + gurobi, PyWake, SHIPP. Place it beside
run_battery_xu_shi_degradation_v5_6_RTE_test.py.

    An arc rather than a bar or a span. A rainflow record is a pair of turning

    interval between them was one continuous excursion: for a residue half cycle
    the two are neighbours on the counting stack and the trace swings up and

    one, appears directly as a small arc under a large one, which is the case
    rainflow exists to resolve and which a bar chart cannot show.

    Full and half are drawn differently because the reader will ask, but the
    distinction is bookkeeping inside the counting rule rather than a physical
    property. A constant-amplitude sequence never closes a loop under the ASTM
    three-point rule, so four half-cycle records at the same depth are two
    physical cycles. Counts, not records, are what enter the damage model.
