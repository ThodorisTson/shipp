Exact per-timestep sub-gradient of the rainflow degradation cost.
================================================================

Replaces build_half_cycle_map + compute_subgradient in degradation_subgradient.py.

Why the attribution map had to go
---------------------------------
Shi et al. define index sets T_{v_i} and T_{w_j} that partition the horizon into half-cycle legs. The rainflow library reports each cycle as a pair of ADJACENT
reversals (i_start, i_end), so [i_start, i_end] is a single monotone leg. A full cycle has two legs, and the second one lies inside the FOLLOWING segment and is
never reported. Example: 0.2 -> 0.5 -> 0.4 -> 0.6. The full cycle of depth 0.1 is the segment 0.5 -> 0.4 together with the first 0.1 of the 0.4 -> 0.6 rise. No
index interval can express that. An attribution map built from [i_start, i_end] therefore cannot reproduce Shi's partition, and no choice of sort order fixes it.

The exact construction
----------------------
Perturbing the charging power c_t raises the energy trace by dt*eta_in*h at every step AFTER t. A cycle's depth changes if and only if its two turning points
straddle t: the later one moves, the earlier one does not. Cycles entirely after t shift bodily and keep their depth. Cycles entirely before t are untouched.

With f = E * B * sum_i n_i * Phi(delta_i)  and  delta_i = |e[b_i] - e[a_i]| / E,

    df/dc_t = + B * dt * eta_in  * G(t)
    df/dd_t = - B * dt / eta_out * G(t)

    G(t) = sum over cycles i with a_i <= t < b_i  of  n_i * Phi'(delta_i) * s_i
    s_i  = sign(e[b_i] - e[a_i]),   a_i = min(i_start, i_end),  b_i = max(...)

G is a suffix indicator sum, so it is one cumulative sum over a difference array:
O(cycles + timesteps), no per-timestep loop, no ownership, no junction rule.

Two properties fall out for free:

  1. The efficiency identity |df/dd_t| / |df/dc_t| = 1 / (eta_in * eta_out) holds POINTWISE and EXACTLY at every t, for any cycle set, because G(t) is common
     to both. It is a real test of the efficiency wiring, unlike a ratio of means over the horizon, which only recovers the coefficient ratio when the charging
     and discharging depth distributions happen to coincide.

  2. Shi Eqs. 17-18 are the special case in which exactly one half-cycle straddles t with n_i = 0.5. Where half-cycles nest, more than one straddles t and the
     sum has more than one term.

Depth-only by construction
--------------------------
Phi(delta) = k3 * delta^k4 carries no mean-SoC or temperature factor. That is deliberate and structural, not an omission:

  - Convexity. Shi Theorem 1 is stated for a stress function of cycle depth alone.
    Multiplying by S_sigma(sigma_i) puts the cost outside the theorem, because sigma_i is a function of the SoC profile.
  - Locality. Cycle DEPTHS are invariant to a uniform shift of the SoC trajectory.
    Cycle MEANS are not. With an S_sigma factor, df/dc_t acquires a contribution from every cycle downstream of t, and on an annual dispatch that non-local term
    exceeds the local depth term by two orders of magnitude.

S_sigma and S_T stay in the Xu reporting path and in the capacity gradient dDegCost/dE_cap, neither of which carries a convexity claim.

Validation (verify_subgradient_exact.py)
----------------------------------------
    smooth timesteps          : median 1.6e-07 % vs central difference
    rainflow topology changes : matches a one-sided derivative to 8e-05 %
    efficiency identity       : exact at every timestep, to 10 decimals
