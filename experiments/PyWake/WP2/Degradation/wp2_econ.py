wp2_econ.py — Shared economic primitives for the WP2 battery sweep models.

Single source of truth for the conventions that MUST stay identical across
    planB_2d_parameter_sweep_a_npv.py
    run_battery_xu_shi_degradation_v5_2__Castillo_sweep_.py

Covered here:
  * symmetric round-trip efficiency split (PCU included)
  * discount / annuity convention (matches the SHIPP kernel)
  * battery capex and replacement-cost scope (energy + power expansion)
  * degradation penalty cost (replacement-energy valuation)
  * arbitrage vs marginal revenue definitions
  * lifetime NPV assembly

Design rule
-----------
PURE MATH ONLY. No SHIPP imports, no I/O, no state, no numpy_financial.
Each caller keeps its own year-loop orchestration; only the formulas live here. If a function starts growing mode= / include_x= flags it has crossed into orchestration and belongs back in the caller.

HORIZON FLIP (pending supervisor decision on 19 vs 20 years)
------------------------------------------------------------
discount_weights() returns weights for years k = 1 .. n_year-1, matching the SHIPP kernel factor `npf.npv(r, ones(n_year)) - 1` (kernel_pyomo.py L146), which sums n_year-1 terms — i.e. drops the final year. 
This is the known off-by-one flagged to the supervisor.

If the full n_year horizon is confirmed, change the single line 
        range(1, n_year)
in discount_weights() to
        range(1, n_year + 1)
After that flip, test_matches_shipp_kernel() is EXPECTED to fail and should be updated to compare against the (n_year + 1) reference. That deliberate failure is the safety net: 
it forces you to acknowledge the convention change in one place instead of silently rescaling every NPV in two files.
