verify_tier2_dispatch.py  --  Tier 2 verification of the dispatch model

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Verification, not validation. Tier 1 (verify_tier1_degradation.py) tested the rainflow counter and the fade models on synthetic state-of-charge traces with
the optimization removed. This file tests the dispatch itself, and its coupling to degradation, on synthetic price signals whose optimal answer is known before
the solver runs.

No ERA5 wind, no DK1 prices. The wind series is a constant and the price series is analytic, so every quantity checked below has a closed form.

TESTS
-----
  T2.1  Dispatch pattern on a sinusoidal price, one week.
        Charges into the daily price minimum and discharges into the maximum, stays inside the SoC window, returns to its starting level, and the
        resulting SoC trace produces exactly seven deep cycles at delta = 0.80.
  T2.2  State-of-charge dynamics on the same solution.
        The kernel imposes the SoC balance as TWO INEQUALITIES,
            e[i+1] - e[i] <= -dt * eta_in  * p[i]
            e[i+1] - e[i] <= -dt / eta_out * p[i]
        so the model may discard energy where the objective is indifferent.
        The test asserts the inequalities hold everywhere and reports how many steps carry slack, which is a direct measurement of the phantom
        micro-cycle mechanism described in the methodology.
  T2.3  Round-trip efficiency threshold.
        With a two-level price of ratio r, diverting 1 MWh from the low block returns r * RTE MWh-equivalent in the high block, so arbitrage is
        profitable if and only if r > 1 / RTE. For this battery RTE = 0.910000056 and the threshold is r = 1.0989010. The test sweeps r
        across it and checks that the battery is idle below, saturates above, and that the observed transition brackets the predicted threshold.

SCOPE
-----
Wind is constant at 160 MW and never exceeds the 325 MW grid limit, so no case here curtails. The lifetime NPV reported in Chapter 4 uses the marginal revenue
basis, which includes curtailment recovery. At this site that term is about 52 kEUR, roughly 0.02% of NPV, because the grid connection equals the installed
wind rating. The curtailment path is therefore not exercised by these tests and carries about 0.02% of the reported value.

WHY IT CALLS THE RUN SCRIPT
---------------------------
The LP is invoked through _solve_shipp() imported from the production run script, so the code path exercised here is the one that produced Chapter 4.
Reimplementing the solver call would verify a copy instead. The run script is import-safe: everything heavy sits inside main().

Battery parameters are read from WP2_Battery.yaml independently of the run script's own builder, so that the efficiency the LP honours is compared against
the efficiency the configuration declares.

OUTPUT
------
  console table of expected vs obtained
  Verification/tier2_verification.csv
  Verification/tier2_verification_table.tex
  Verification/fig_verify_dispatch_week.pdf / .png
  Verification/fig_verify_rte_threshold.pdf / .png

Reproducible on Windows / VS Code. Needs pyomo + gurobi, as the SoC window is only enforced in the Pyomo branch of the kernel.
